  Thanks for signing the pledge of integrity - I've signed this file myself
  below as a witness to that pledge. We're gonna make COMP2300 awesome this
  year, and conducting ourselves with integrity is a key part of that.

  As an added bonus, this is the same process we'll use for giving marks &
  feedback for your assignments, so since you're reading this you know where to
  look for that stuff when the time comes.
